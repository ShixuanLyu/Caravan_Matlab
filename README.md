# Caravan_Matlab
Hi, welcome to the Caravan_Matlab. There are codes to help you load Caravan dataset (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-01975-w) into Matlab. which are very convenient for Matlab users. 
Since the processed data is very large, only codes are provided here. But sufficient RAM is required for your computer.

# Reference
All the Matlab codes are based on SebastianGnann/CAMELS_Matlab. You can find more details here: https://github.com/SebastianGnann/CAMELS_Matlab. 
In addition, Sebastian also calculate hydrological signatures for the Caravan dataset, you can find it here: https://github.com/SebastianGnann/TOSSH_signatures_Caravan.
